# HWSUK FAQ

[A simple FAQ site to answer commonly-asked questions in the HardwareSwapUK community.](https://faq.hardwareswap.uk)

[Based on Texture theme by samarsault](https://github.com/samarsault/texture)

## Development dependencies
- A working Ruby installation, with bundler
- Optional: a proper markdown editor, or a text editor with markdown preview built in, such as Visual Studio Code (Ctrl/Cmd+K, V to enable markdown preview)

## Development

With Ruby installed, run `bundle install` to install all of the required gems, should you wish to start a local copy of the FAQ. 

Then, executing:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

will start the server on port 4000, go to http://localhost:4000 to see the local copy of the site. 

The server will watch for changes to posts, but you may need to restart with `^C` if you modify theme-related files.

Content can be found in the `_posts` directory - edit here if you wish to add new posts or modify the content of existing posts.

After merging a pull request, it is automatically deployed to the Netlify production site within a couple of minutes, and will be viewable [on the production site.](https://faq.hardwareswap.uk)
