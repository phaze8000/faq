This FAQ section aims to cover timestamps, why we use them and why they're important.

# What are timestamps?

Put simply, timestamps are images that serve as proof that you have a particular item in your possession. Usually, they take the form of a picture of the item, with your username and today's date visible in written form on the image.

As a reminder, proxy listing is forbidden under the subreddit rules - the item must be in **your possession.**

# Do I need a timestamp?

Timestamps are required for **all selling posts on the _subreddit_.** Timestamps aren't required in the Discord, but it's good practice to provide them and you **must be able to show them when requested.**

# What are the requirements for a valid timestamp?

- The timestamp photo must clearly show the item (not just the box), and the timestamp in the same image.
    - Photos with edited text are not acceptable - there must be an item in the photo, for example a piece of paper or a laptop with Notepad that shows the timestamp.
    - The only exception is sealed items - these must clearly show the seal on the box as well as the timestamp.
- Show the exact model number of the item you're selling if possible.
- Only one of the images in a collection of images needs to be timestamped, as long as it meets the requirements.
- Timestamps must be dated within 5 days of the post.

# How do I upload timestamps?

The easiest way is to use [Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload) - upload as many images as you see fit, then copy and paste the gallery link provided once the upload has finished.
