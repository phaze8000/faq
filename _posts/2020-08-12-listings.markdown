This post aims to cover trade listings, both in the subreddit and in Discord `#buy-sell-trade`.

# How do I make a buying post?

All buying posts should have a title beginning with `[BG]`.

- Think of a brief title for the item you want to buy. For example, "Corsair SF600 PSU". Use the `[W]` tag in your title to denote this.
- Think about your budget and what payment methods are available to you. Use the `[H]` tag in your title to denote this.
    - As an example, your title should look like this: `[BG] [W] Corsair SF600 PSU [H] £100 PayPal`
- If this is a Reddit post, in your post body, provide more details about what it is you want to buy if necessary.

# How do I make a selling post?

All selling posts should have a title beginning with `[SG]`.

- Think of a brief title for the item you want to sell. For example, "AMD Ryzen 7 3700X". Use the `[H]` tag in your title to denote this.
- Think about your sale price and what payment methods are available for you to receive payments. Use the `[W]` tag in your title to denote this.
